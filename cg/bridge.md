## Setup

### Players and Partnerships

- **4 players** form **2 partnerships**
- Partners sit **opposite** each other
- Players are designated by compass directions:
  - **North-South** (one partnership)
  - **East-West** (opposing partnership)

```
        North
         (N)
          |
West (W) + East (E)
          |
        South
         (S)
```

### Equipment

- **Standard 52-card deck** (no jokers)
- **Score sheet** or electronic scoring
- **Bidding boxes** (optional, for silent bidding)
- **Boards** (in duplicate bridge, to hold pre-dealt cards)

---

## Card Rankings

### Suit Ranking (High to Low)

For bidding purposes:
```
No Trump (NT) > ♠ Spades > ♥ Hearts > ♦ Diamonds > ♣ Clubs
```

### Card Ranking Within Suits (High to Low)

```
Ace (A) > King (K) > Queen (Q) > Jack (J) > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2
```

- **Ace is highest**, not lowest
- **Trump cards beat all non-trump cards** regardless of rank

---

## The Deal

### Determining Dealer and Partners (First Hand)

1. **Spread deck face-down**
2. Each player draws a card
3. **Two highest cards** become partners (sit opposite)
4. **Highest card** is dealer and chooses seat
5. **Next highest** sits across from dealer

### Dealing the Cards

1. Player to **dealer's left** shuffles
2. Player to **dealer's right** cuts the deck
3. Dealer distributes cards **clockwise**, one at a time
4. Each player receives **13 cards**
5. Deal rotates clockwise for subsequent hands

### Duplicate Bridge Variation

- Cards are **pre-dealt** (by hand or machine)
- Placed in a **board** with 4 slots (N, S, E, W)
- Same hands played at multiple tables for comparison
- Enables competitive tournament scoring

---

## The Auction (Bidding)

### Bidding Basics

The auction determines:
1. **The contract** (how many tricks to win)
2. **Trump suit** (or No Trump)
3. **The declarer** (who plays the contract)

### Understanding Bids

A bid consists of:
- **Level** (1-7): Number of tricks **beyond 6** ("book")
- **Denomination**: Trump suit or No Trump (NT)

**Examples:**
- `1♠` = 7 tricks with Spades as trump
- `3NT` = 9 tricks with No Trump
- `7♥` = 13 tricks (all) with Hearts as trump (Grand Slam)

### Bid Levels Chart

| Bid Level | Tricks Needed | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 7 | Minimum contract |
| 2 | 8 | |
| 3 | 9 | Game in NT (3NT) |
| 4 | 10 | Game in ♠/♥ (4♠, 4♥) |
| 5 | 11 | Game in ♣/♦ (5♣, 5♦) |
| 6 | 12 | **Small Slam** |
| 7 | 13 | **Grand Slam** (all tricks) |

### Bidding Order

1. **Dealer** opens the auction (may pass or bid)
2. Bidding proceeds **clockwise**
3. Each player may:
   - **Pass**: Decline to bid (can bid later)
   - **Bid**: Name a contract higher than previous bid
   - **Double**: Increase stakes on opponent's bid
   - **Redouble**: Further increase stakes after partner is doubled

### Overcalling (Bidding Higher)

Each bid must be higher than the previous:
- **Higher level** (2♣ beats 1NT)
- **Same level, higher suit** (3♠ beats 3♦)
- Remember: NT > ♠ > ♥ > ♦ > ♣

**Examples:**
- 1♣ → 1♦ → 1♥ → 1♠ → 1NT → 2♣...
- Cannot bid 2♦ after 2♥ (must bid 2♠, 2NT, or 3+ of any suit)

### Doubling and Redoubling

**Double (X):**
- Only on **opponent's bid**
- Increases penalties for failure
- Increases rewards for success
- Says: "I don't think you can make it"

**Redouble (XX):**
- Only after partner's bid is doubled
- Further multiplies stakes
- Says: "We're confident we can make it"

### Ending the Auction

Auction ends when:
- **3 consecutive passes** after a bid/double/redouble
- **4 consecutive passes** (deal is passed out, re-deal)

The **final contract** is the last bid made.

### Example Auction

| West | North | East | South |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| Pass | 1♥ | Pass | 2♥ |
| Pass | 4♥ | Pass | Pass |
| Pass | | | |

**Result:** Contract is **4♥** (10 tricks with Hearts as trump)
**Declarer:** North (first to bid Hearts)

---

## The Play

### Before Play Begins

1. **Declarer:** Player who first bid the denomination of the final contract
2. **Dummy:** Declarer's partner
3. **Defenders:** The opposing partnership
4. **Opening lead:** Player to **declarer's left** leads first card

### The Dummy Hand

1. **After opening lead**, dummy spreads their cards **face-up** on table
2. Cards organized by **suit in columns**
3. **Trump suit** (if any) to dummy's right
4. **Declarer controls both hands** (their own + dummy's)
5. Dummy cannot make decisions or comments

### Playing to a Trick

1. **Leader** plays any card face-up
2. Other players **follow clockwise**
3. **Must follow suit** if possible
4. If **void** (no cards in led suit), may play any card:
   - Play **trump** to try to win
   - Discard ("slough") card from another suit

### Winning a Trick

Trick won by:
- **Highest trump** played, OR
- **Highest card of suit led** (if no trump played)

**Winner of trick leads to next trick**

### Example Trick (Spades are Trump)

| Position | Card Played | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| West (lead) | 8♥ | Leads Hearts |
| North | K♥ | Follows suit, high |
| East | 2♠ | Void in Hearts, plays trump |
| South | A♥ | Follows with Ace |

**Winner:** East (trump beats all non-trump)

### Playing All 13 Tricks

- Continue until all cards played
- Keep tricks separated to count them
- Declarer tries to make contract
- Defenders try to prevent it

### Claiming

At any point, a player may **claim** remaining tricks:
1. Shows cards and explains play
2. Opponents can accept or dispute
3. If disputed, play continues or director rules (duplicate)

---

## Scoring

### Two Main Variations

1. **Rubber Bridge:** Social game, first to 2 games wins rubber
2. **Duplicate Bridge:** Tournament, comparative scoring across tables

### Contract Points (Below the Line)

If declarer **makes contract**, score odd tricks bid:

| Trump Suit | Points per Odd Trick |
|------------|----------------------|
| ♣ Clubs | 20 |
| ♦ Diamonds | 20 |
| ♥ Hearts | 30 |
| ♠ Spades | 30 |
| NT No Trump | 40 (first), 30 (each additional) |

**Modified by:**
- **Doubled:** ×2
- **Redoubled:** ×4

**Game = 100+ contract points**

### Game Contracts

To reach game in one deal:
- **3NT** (9 tricks): 40+30+30 = 100 points
- **4♠ or 4♥** (10 tricks): 4×30 = 120 points  
- **5♣ or 5♦** (11 tricks): 5×20 = 100 points

### Part-Score
Any contract scoring less than 100 points.

### Overtricks (Above the Line)

Tricks won **beyond the contract**:

| Condition | Points per Overtrick |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Not Doubled | Same as contract suit |
| Doubled, Not Vulnerable | 100 |
| Doubled, Vulnerable | 200 |
| Redoubled | Double the doubled values |

### Vulnerability

**Vulnerable** = Has won one game (increases stakes)

**In Rubber Bridge:**
- Not vulnerable until winning first game
- Then vulnerable for rest of rubber

**In Duplicate Bridge:**
- Pre-determined by board number
- Rotates through combinations

### Slam Bonuses

**Small Slam (6-level, 12 tricks):**
- Not Vulnerable: 500 points
- Vulnerable: 750 points

**Grand Slam (7-level, 13 tricks):**
- Not Vulnerable: 1,000 points
- Vulnerable: 1,500 points

### Other Bonuses (Rubber Bridge)

- **Making Doubled Contract:** +50
- **Making Redoubled Contract:** +100
- **Winning Rubber (2 games):**
  - Opponents won 0 games: +700
  - Opponents won 1 game: +500
- **Honors (all in one hand):**
  - 4 trump honors (A-K-Q-J-10): +100
  - 5 trump honors: +150
  - 4 Aces (No Trump): +150

### Undertrick Penalties (Failed Contract)

If declarer **fails to make contract**, defenders score:

#### Not Vulnerable:
| Undertricks | Not Doubled | Doubled |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 1st | 50 | 100 |
| 2nd | 50 | 200 |
| 3rd | 50 | 200 |
| 4th+ | 50 | 300 each |

#### Vulnerable:
| Undertricks | Not Doubled | Doubled |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 1st | 100 | 200 |
| 2nd+ | 100 | 300 each |

**Redoubled:** Double the doubled penalties

### Scoring Example

**Contract:** 4♥ (10 tricks), Not Vulnerable  
**Result:** Made 11 tricks (1 overtrick)

**Score:**
- Contract: 4 × 30 = **120** (below line = GAME)
- Overtrick: 1 × 30 = **30** (above line)
- **Total: 150 points**

## Bidding Systems

Bidding systems assign meanings to bids beyond just the literal contract.

### Common Systems

1. **Standard American (SAYC)**
   - Most popular in North America
   - 5-card major opening (1♠/1♥ shows 5+ cards)
   - 15-17 HCP for 1NT opening

2. **Acol**
   - Popular in UK
   - 4-card major opening
   - Weak 1NT (12-14 HCP)

3. **2/1 Game Forcing**
   - Advanced system
   - 2-level response creates game force
   - Very popular in tournaments

### Hand Evaluation: High Card Points (HCP)

| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| Ace | 4 |
| King | 3 |
| Queen | 2 |
| Jack | 1 |

**Total deck = 40 HCP**  
**Average hand = 10 HCP**

### Opening Bid Guidelines (SAYC)

- **1 of suit:** 13+ HCP, 5+ cards (majors), 3+ cards (minors)
- **1NT:** 15-17 HCP, balanced distribution
- **2NT:** 20-21 HCP, balanced
- **3NT:** 25-27 HCP, balanced
- **Weak Two (2♦/♥/♠):** 6-10 HCP, 6-card suit
- **Strong 2♣:** 22+ HCP, game-forcing

### Common Conventions

- **Stayman:** 2♣ response to 1NT asks for 4-card major
- **Jacoby Transfer:** 2♦ over 1NT shows hearts, 2♥ shows spades
- **Blackwood:** 4NT asks for aces (for slam bidding)
- **Gerber:** 4♣ asks for aces (alternative)
- **Takeout Double:** Double for takeout, not penalties
- **Negative Double:** Responder's double shows values

## Strategy

### Bidding Strategy

#### 1. Communicate with Partner
- Bids convey:
  - **Strength** (HCP)
  - **Distribution** (suit lengths)
  - **Support** for partner's suit

#### 2. Evaluate Your Hand
- Count **HCP** (4-3-2-1)
- Consider **distribution points:**
  - Void (no cards in suit): +3
  - Singleton (1 card): +2
  - Doubleton (2 cards): +1
- Look for **8-card fit** (combined suit length)

#### 3. Game Requirements
- **3NT:** 25+ combined HCP
- **4♠/4♥:** 25+ HCP + 8-card fit
- **5♣/5♦:** 28+ HCP + 8-card fit (often better to try 3NT)

#### 4. Slam Requirements
- **Small Slam (6):** 33+ HCP
- **Grand Slam (7):** 37+ HCP
- Must have **controls** (Aces and Kings)

#### 5. Competitive Bidding
- Overcall with **good suit + values**
- Jump to **game with fit** (preemptive)
- Sacrifice when opponents have game

### Declarer Play Strategy

#### 1. Count Your Winners and Losers
- **NT:** Count top tricks (Aces, Kings)
- **Trump:** Count losers in side suits

#### 2. Make a Plan
- Determine how to **develop extra tricks**:
  - Establish long suit
  - Finesse for missing honors
  - Ruff losers in dummy
  - Discard losers

#### 3. Manage Trump
- Usually **draw trump** first (remove opponents' trump)
- Exception: Need to ruff losers first

#### 4. Entry Management
- Plan how to get between hands
- Preserve entries to long suits
- Unblock high cards

#### 5. Watch for Finesses
- **Finesse:** Play toward honor, hoping opponent has missing card
- Example: Lead toward K-Q, hoping opponent has A

### Defensive Strategy

#### 1. Opening Lead Selection

**Against Suit Contracts:**
- **Partner's suit** (if bid)
- **Top of sequence** (K from KQJ, Q from QJ10)
- **4th highest** from long suit
- **Singleton** (for ruff potential)

**Against No Trump:**
- **4th highest** from longest/strongest suit
- **Partner's suit** if bid

#### 2. Signals

**Attitude Signals:**
- **High card:** Encouraging (like the suit)
- **Low card:** Discouraging

**Count Signals:**
- **High-low:** Even number of cards
- **Low-high:** Odd number of cards

**Suit Preference:**
- When leading, card rank suggests which suit to return

#### 3. Second Hand Low
- When partner leads and you're next, usually play low
- Exception: Must win to prevent dummy's winner

#### 4. Third Hand High
- When partner leads and you're third to play, play high
- Exception: Split honors (Q from QJ)

#### 5. Cover an Honor with an Honor
- When declarer leads honor from dummy, cover if profitable
- Promotes partner's lower cards

### Common Tactics

**Finesse:** Lead toward honor combination, hoping opponent has missing card on left

**Hold-Up:** Refuse to win early tricks to break communication

**Ducking:** Play low to preserve entry

**Ruffing:** Trump opponents' winners in dummy

**Crossruff:** Ruff in both hands alternately

**Squeeze:** Force opponent to discard winner

**Endplay:** Force opponent to lead to your advantage
